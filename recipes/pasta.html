          So, you're standing in the grocery store looking at an endless display
          of pasta noodles and you ask yourself, "How do you cook pasta?" The
          good news is, it's not hard. In fact, it's one of the easiest bits of
          cooking you can do. Still, there are a few simple tricks to master so
          your pasta turns out just right. We'll show you how to cook pasta,
          including how long to cook pasta, and answer some frequently asked
          questions about how to cook pasta noodles.

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Bring the water to a full, rolling boil. Before adding the pasta, add
          salt to the boiling water. If you don't season the cooking water, the
          pasta may taste flat — no matter how salty the sauce may be. The
          temperature of the water will drop once you add the pasta, so make
          sure the water's at a full boil before adding the pasta noodles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir gently. Short pasta should be stirred immediately after adding it
          to water, but let spaghetti and long strands soften for a minute
          before stirring. Leave the pot uncovered while the pasta cooks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook your pasta at a rapid boil until it's tender but slightly firm to
          the bite. The longer you cook pasta, the mushier it gets. Don't rely
          on the clock to evaluate doneness; bite a piece instead. If it's done,
          it will be firm but tender and cooked through. If you're using cooked
          pasta as an ingredient in a recipe — like baked ziti or lasagna — it
          can be even firmer, as the noodles will absorb liquid and cook more in
          the oven.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drain the pasta in a colander. Do not rinse the pasta with water
          unless your recipe specifically says to. For example, if you're making
          a cold pasta salad, you would rinse the hot pasta with cool water to
          stop the cooking. Lasagna is another example of a pasta noodle that
          can be rinsed after cooking. Otherwise, return the drained pasta to
          the pot and cover to keep it warm, or toss it with sauce. Here's where
          the reserved pasta water comes in handy to help thicken or thin the
          sauce, depending on the recipe you use.
        </li>
        <li>Serve pasta immediately. We highly recommend using warm bowls!</li>
